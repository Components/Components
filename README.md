Components
==========

Package manager-friendly distributions of many popular [Components](http://github.com/components).


Package Managers
----------------

Although package manager support varies from package to package, Components aims
to support as many package managers as possible. Some examples include:

* [npm](http://npmjs.org)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/)
* [Component](http://github.com/component/component)
* [Jam](http://jamjs.org)
* [volo](http://volojs.org)
* [Ender](http://ender.jit.su)
* [Composer](http://getcomposer.org)
* [Package Manager Comparision](https://github.com/wilmoore/frontend-packagers)


Contributing
------------

If you see a Component that requires an update, or is missing support for a
certain package manager, feel free to create an issue in the Component's issue
queue.
